Underbar, Part I: _.identity() through _.reduce()

[Course] Underbar
DURATION: 5 - 10 Hours
A fun project that has you re-implementing powerful and useful helper functions from the Underscore.js library.

Before Moving On

Start using the Chrome DevTools to debug your JavaScript code. In particular, use the following tools:

debugger statements and breakpoints
Watch expressions
Check your code and make sure that you're re-using functions whenever possible; for example, you should have re-used each inside of map.
Understand the following functions and what they do:
_.each()
_.indexOf()
_.map()
_.reduce()
_.filter()
_.reject()
Be familiar with the rest of the Underbar functions you've implemented thus far.
Ensure that all tests pass for the Bare Minimum Requirements in part I of the Underbar repo and that your work has been pushed to your fork on GitHub.
Part II

Underbar, Part II: _.contains() through _.shuffle()

[Course] Underbar
DURATION: 10 - 12 Hours
Part two of implementing parts of the Underscore.js library.

Before Moving On

Understand the following functions, what they do, and how they are implemented:

_.extend()
_.defaults()
_.once()
_.memoize()
_.delay()
Be familiar with the rest of the Underbar functions.

Have a basic understanding of closures, lexical scope, and know what it means for a variable to be "in scope".
Be familiar with how you used .call and .apply in your solutions. Don't worry if you don't yet understand what this or null means when passed in as the first argument to them.
Ensure all tests are passing for the Bare Minimum Requirements in part II of the Underbar repo and that your work has been pushed to your fork on GitHub.
